# Quamtum-Applications

In this repository are available the codes for Shor's and Grover's quantum algorithms, used in consolidating the D-GM environment as a quantum computing simulator and validating the HybriD-GM for modeling hybrid computation.

The research group discusses the achieved outcomes on all simulations in the paper:
